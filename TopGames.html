        <a href="https://www.dosgamesarchive.com/file/doom/doom95/"><h3>10. Doom</h3></a>
        <h5>RELEASED 2016 | LAST POSITION 11</h5>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qae8WrdbyFKsMaPPTNkCPR-650-80.jpg">
        <p><b>Wes:</b> More games should start with a mission statement. In Doom, that statement is “Shut up and let me kill things.” It follows through on this by making the killing very, very good, but critically, it captures the same feeling of exploring tightly packed, intricate spaces that helped made 1993’s Doom a PC gaming phenomenon. The shotgun also helps.<br>
        
        <b>Phil:</b> Glory kills were a masterstroke. A lot of shooters incentivise you to get close up to the action—to overcommit past the point of safety—through small tricks of level design, or subtle tweaks to a bullet’s damage fall-off. Doom does it by letting you brutally tear up a demon until they explode in a shower of health. It’s absurd, loud, fun.</p>
    
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/863550/HITMAN_2/"><h3>9. Hitman 2</h3></a>
        <h5>RELEASED 2018 | LAST POSITION New entry</h5>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhNZR8UUF5mNVeFCyNhNJY-650-80.jpg">
        <p><b>Phil:</b> Hitman 2 is the best stealth murder sim. Its six levels are huge, varied and full of surprising ways to kill the deserving targets. With the Legacy Pack DLC adding in all of the previous game’s episodes too, this becomes a massive platform for IO Interactive’s assassination puzzles. <br>

        <b>Samuel:</b> Downloading all the Hitman levels into Hitman 2 then playing them sequentially was the best 100 hours of my 2018. So many great murder boxes, in a fantastic, modern format with perfect controls, offering loads of scope for player-made stories. <br>
            
        <b>James:</b> Pure catharsis for these trying times. Imagine the worst people in the world. You get to take them out however you want. Don’t feel bad.</p>
        
        <a href="https://www.origin.com/ind/en-us/store/apex/apex"><h3>8. Apex Legends</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C2ZumGXHx3egPp7hjvjDRa-650-80.jpg">
        <p>Apex Legends is the best battle royale game available now. The map is fantastic, the 'ping' communication system is something every FPS should have from here on, the guns and movement are great fun (no wallrunning, but sliding down hills feels great), and it's free-to-play with nothing to pay for except cosmetics. It isn't the game we expected from Respawn, but we're glad it's here. Check <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-review/">James' review</a> for more.

        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/359550/"><h3>7. Rainbow Six Siege</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JPZ4vWJNZbLhbekpAUvMd-650-80.jpg">
        <p>Counter-Strike's sexier cousin. Siege might lack the sharp hit detection and purity of CS:GO, but it's a more accessible and modern FPS that rewards clever timing and coordinated teamwork as much as aim. Siege's learning curve is a result of all the stuff (characters, gadgets, elaborate maps, and guns) that's been added since December 2015, but eventually you find yourself picking operators, map spots, and roles that you're comfortable with. Ubisoft continues to support Siege, dropping four major updates per year along with regular fixes.

        <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/"><h3>6. Overwatch</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t3iX3o2552asFXFqmkjgDZ-650-80.jpg">
        <p>With Overwatch's colorful characters and bright, inclusive world, Blizzard brought the world of team-based hero shooters to an entirely new market. Teams of six take the roles of tank, DPS, and healer to battle over objectives, not just who can get the most kills. It's a game that rewards—if not requires—teamwork. And with a growing cast of now 27 heroes to choose from, there's a character to fit just about any play style.</p>

        <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/home"><h3>5. Fortnite</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2tQwy2gEsnLtmJfZtNoymY-650-80.jpg">
        <p>What started as a sterile PUBG imitation has evolved into the Minecraft generation’s arena shooter. Fortnite’s building system rewards good aim and an eye for architecture equally, extending battle royale shootouts from green pastures to impromptu skyscrapers slapped together in a minute. With ridiculously frequent updates from Epic Games that introduce new weapons, traps, tools, and skins, Fortnite is easily worth the price of admission, and even then, worth the time it takes to master such an obtuse, irregular building system.</p>

        <a href="https://www.pubg.com/"><h3>4. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5xpJzmH4NSNFvSbxbFLEP-650-80.jpg">
        <p>100 murderous hopefuls skydive onto an abandoned island, grab whatever weapons and ammo they can find, and fight to the death. Rinse and repeat. Though the concept wasn't new (PlayerUnknown himself is responsible for multiple battle royale modes and mods), PUBG made the battle royale genre into the phenomenon that it is today. As a third- or first-person shooter, PUBG is more realistic and less arcadey than Fortnite. The joy of it is how it forces players to move and take risks as an ever-shrinking forcefield funnels surviving players toward each other until a winner climbs out of the wreckage. Every instant of every game is a flood of important decisions to make, and any one of them—even a minor one—could lead to your doom. </p>

        <a href="https://www.origin.com/ind/en-us/store/battlefield/battlefield-v"><h3>3. Battlefield</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZWdh23ckSD7TCP8hLS87HH-650-80.jpg">
        <p>While Battlefield 1 diehards insist that it's the superior game, we recommend both BF1 and BF5. On BF5's side, EA has done away with paid seasons passes, and is releasing all new maps free, plus there's a battle royale mode now. 
        <br>   
        Meanwhile, though, <a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/battlefield/battlefield-1/offer-selection">Battlefield 1</a> is included with Origin Access (both Basic and Premium) and is pretty cheap otherwise, so if the World War 1 setting appeals to you, it's a low-cost entry into the series.
        <br>    
        Here's our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-1-review/">Battlefield 1 review</a>, and our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-review/">Battlefield 5 review</a>.</p>

        <a href="https://craxgames.com/gta-5-download-for-free/"><h3>2. Grand Theft Auto 5</h3></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lf9fbStDf37vWxuRpPm4ud-650-80.jpg">
        <p>GTA 5 runs beautifully on PC, and its open world is still the best of any game, a gorgeous sprawl that replicates everything we associate with Los Angeles: the flat heat, the atmosphere, the fact that the city is so damn big. The campaign is the series' best ever, punctuated by ambitious heist missions involving all three protagonists. It's a lot of fun to spend time in this world.
        <br>
        If you want to take things further, GTA Online is waiting for you with an absolute ton of stuff to do. Not all of it is amazing, but with a few friends, it's great fun to knock through the Online mode's bespoke heists, and owning a business feels pretty cool too. There are plenty of ways to play this game forever, including all of these great mods.
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.origin.com/ind/en-us/store/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-odyssey"><i><h3>1. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h3></i></a>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gQ67eyMXtGwq2b72qwBCDX-650-80.png">
        <p>Ubisoft nailed the latest in the Assassin's Creed series, fully embracing the roleplaying genre and retooling its typical open world to-do list into an adventure full of quests worth doing—all set in its grandest world to date.
        </p>

        <u><h3>Honorable Mentions</h3></u>
        <h3>Dishonored 2</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DnEYXFfLxnxrp22X8fWWsJ-650-80.png">
        <p>The best immersive sim around, with sprawling, complicated levels that are wonderful to unpack, as well as a couple of high-concept missions that you'll never forget. It's like Arkane made a sequel based on how much everyone loved Lady Boyle's Last Party in Dishonored—most of the levels here are just as good. The option to play as two characters, with their own version of the story and sets of powers, offers even more replay value.
        <br>   
        Crucially, too, Dishonored 2 offers more non-lethal ways to play if you're not a perfect stealth player. Being able to block enemy sword attacks, get them into a chokehold, shove them over then boot them in the face, knocking them out, is the best fun. Likewise, using Emily's domino ability to knock out multiple enemies at once feels incredibly empowering. And that's just one of many ways you can play.</p>

        <h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HCzCgHyDuKxpwuBG9PmGMA-650-80.jpg">
        <p>The Witcher 3 follows Geralt, the world's grumpiest monster-slaying bounty hunter, as he fights and magics his way across a medieval fantasy world. It tells a well-written, clever story, but more importantly, The Witcher 3 is the best open-world RPG you can explore right now (and quite possibly the best there's ever been).
        <br>    
        The Witcher 3 is great mostly because it's so full of things to do. It's a huge world chockablock with ghouls, vampires, and wraiths—and the people can be pretty nasty, too. The size and depth of the world gives every quest context, an anchor that feels like it stretches back into history. Investigating a haunted farmhouse, for example, turns up clues about the type of spectre involved. Choosing the right weapon and brewing up a special potion feel like steps in a centuries-old ceremony. The Witcher 3 is a triumph of worldbuilding.</p>
